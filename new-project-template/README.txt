Welcome to the Apigee App Services template app for iOS!

App Services is Apigee’s hosted version of the open-source technology “Usergrid” — you may find references to that name in a few places. 

To get started, open this project in XCode: just double-click the file called “Apigee App Services iOS Template.xcodeproj” in the Finder.

You will need to make a few edits for this template to work. Follow the instructions in iOS Template/Client.m

If you followed the steps correctly, you should see a visual confirmation when you run the app!


P.S.: You can install XCode from the Mac App Store. XCode is Mac only… You cannot develop iOS applications from anything but an Apple machine
